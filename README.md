# üåê Building a Full Serverless Three-Tier Web Application on AWS

---

## Project Overview  
I designed and deployed a fully serverless **three-tier web application** using **AWS services**, using cloud architecture principles. My goal was to create a scalable, low-maintenance app by separating the presentation, logic, and data tiers ‚Äî all without managing servers.

## Project Highlights 

### What I Did:  
- üóÇÔ∏è **Hosted Static Website on S3**: Served frontend assets from Amazon S3.  
- üåç **Distributed Globally with CloudFront**: Implemented CloudFront to improve performance and reduce latency.  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Created RESTful Backend with Lambda + API Gateway**: Developed serverless functions for backend logic and utilised them via API Gateway.  
- üßæ **Stored User Data in DynamoDB**: Implemented a scalable NoSQL data layer.  
- üîê **Configured IAM Roles**: Set up secure permissions for cross-service communication.
